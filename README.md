# Shopping-Cart

This assignment required me to make a shopping cart for books that could display all of the user's selected items, calculate the total, and calculate the different costs associated with each when being added to the cart. The user has two options audiobooks and physical books and can add or remove items from the cart and have the prices adjusted.
